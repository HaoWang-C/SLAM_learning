## Learning ICP algorithm

1. Loca and Cost Jacob:

2. Set the jacob size:

## TODO-lists
1. Learn previous section-1
2. Revisit:
    - Gaussian-Newton from slam14 and Rob530
    - Jacobian computation from slam14(derivative model and pertubation model) and Rob530
    - Look careful how they compute the jacobian
    - Maybe: Micro Lie theory and state estimation for roboticsist
3. Update my note and achive following things:
    - Derive the Jacobian of the error function by hand (w.r.t. SE(3) and se(3))
    - Figure out(roughly) how Ceres actually use the Jacobians to do the update
